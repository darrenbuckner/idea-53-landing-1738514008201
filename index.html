            <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Market Opportunity</h3>
                <p>The target market includes parents of children aged 4-10 who are increasingly seeking educational, non-screen alternatives for their kids.

                <h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
                <p>While there are platforms offering audio storytelling and children’s content, few specifically target personalized, AI-driven educational audio experiences. This differentiation gives the idea a competitive edge despite existing content providers.</p>

                <div>Score: 85</div>
                <p>There is a large and growing market in the edtech sector, particularly among parents seeking high-quality, screen-free, and educational content for children.

                <p>While AI technology has advanced enough for content personalization and audio generation, integrating professional narration, sound effects, and maintaining high quality across multiple languages and topics poses technical challenges.
